// PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit and SubagentStart hook: the memory
// recognition nudge.
//
// The memory store pushes once and pulls thereafter: the index rides into a
// session's start and `memq` serves whoever asks. The session that most needs
// a record is the one that does not know to ask, and by the time the work
// touches what a memory is about, the start-of-session index has faded or a
// compaction has dropped it. This hook is the pull the session did not make:
// it watches the moments a session is processing something new, matches each
// against the recognition triggers of every tier this project reads and
// against the project tier's own file anchors, and puts a one-line pointer in
// front of the model naming the record to read.
//
// A nudge is a POINTER, never a body. It carries the record's name, the
// trigger that fired, one clause of why, and the `memq get <name>` spelling,
// and nothing out of the record's text. The session hunts the specifics
// itself, which keeps the injection cheap, respects the context window, and
// preserves the recall-then-verify discipline: a body quoted here would be
// read as fact without anybody opening the record.
//
// THE FOUR BOUNDARIES, and why the trigger types are split across them. Two
// watch the tool stream and two watch the session's lifecycle; each one is
// given the types its own payload can actually answer for, since a type
// matched against a subject the boundary does not carry is a trigger nobody
// can ever fire.
//
//   PreToolUse       cmd, skill, agent, tool. Each of these is knowable from
//                    the call's own request, and a command-shaped hazard's
//                    nudge is worth nothing after the command has run. The
//                    pre-boundary is where a memory about a destructive
//                    command can still be acted on.
//   PostToolUse      err, glob, and the record's file anchors. None of these
//                    exists until the call has returned: a failure signature
//                    is in the output, and the paths a call touched are only
//                    certain once it has touched them. Recognition lands the
//                    moment the evidence exists rather than on a guess about
//                    it.
//   UserPromptSubmit cmd, err, skill, agent and tool, from the project tier
//                    alone, and from no tier at all while a store pin
//                    (KIT_MEMORY_PROJECT) is in effect, against the prompt's
//                    own text. This is the earliest moment in a turn at which
//                    anything is known about what the session is being asked
//                    to do, and it is before the first tool call rather than
//                    inside it, so a memory about the whole task arrives while
//                    the approach is still being chosen. `glob` is excluded
//                    outright: it is matched by globMatchesPath against the
//                    paths a call actually touched, and a prompt has touched
//                    nothing, so a glob here would be matched against prose
//                    rather than against a path. Every other type is confined
//                    because a prompt is prose rather than a field, so any
//                    match against it is a guess about what the words mean,
//                    and memq's authoring bars screen a pattern against a
//                    command line or a failure's output while nothing screens
//                    one against English; the pin is read because confinement
//                    to one checkout is the whole of what admits a tier here,
//                    and a pinned tier serves every repository the instance
//                    works in. See collectHits.
//   SubagentStart    agent alone, and nothing at all into a read-only judgment
//                    seat. The dispatch payload carries no dispatch
//                    input at all: what it names is the session, the
//                    transcript, the working directory, the prompt and agent
//                    ids, the event name and the agent type, alongside the
//                    session-shaped fields every event carries. So the only
//                    subject in it is the type of agent being started, and
//                    `agent` is the only type that names one. Every other type
//                    would be matched against nothing.
//
// WHERE EACH BOUNDARY'S INJECTION LANDS, which is not the same answer for all
// four. The tool boundaries and UserPromptSubmit inject into the session that
// produced the event. SubagentStart injects into THE SUBAGENT being started,
// not into the orchestrator that dispatched it. That is the point of wiring it
// rather than a limitation of it: a dispatched agent inherits no memory
// context whatsoever, no session-start index and no nudge the parent already
// received, so this is the only channel by which a subagent learns that a
// record exists at all.
//
// That reach is also why one class of dispatch receives nothing. The kit's
// read-only judgment seats, the blind and adversarial and security reviewers,
// the consultant, the blind reader, the prose reviewer, the council member and
// the design facilitator, are dispatched precisely to hold a context that
// inherited nothing, and a pointer the store authored is exactly the intent
// story a blind review is dispatched without. The policy class is
// kit-agent-identity-lib.js's reviewAgentClass, shared with the guard that
// refuses those seats a tree-mutating command; its `gate` class and every type
// nothing governs still receive pointers, a QA verifier and an implementer both
// benefiting from what the store knows. A verdict-producing seat is on that
// side of the line because it is dispatched WITH the spec and so is not blind,
// so a pointer adds no intent story it lacks.
//
// A SUGGESTION IS THE WHOLE AUTHORITY HERE. What every boundary emits is one
// `additionalContext` string and nothing else, which is the only key the
// installed CLI's `SubagentStart` output shape admits in any case. The restraint
// the store's reach earns is on that channel rather than beside it: a nudge
// names a record and the session decides, and this hook does not rewrite the
// brief a dispatcher wrote, because editing one would make this machinery an
// author of the work rather than a pointer at the store, and nothing in a
// matched trigger justifies that.
//
// The two tool registrations carry the match-all matcher `*`, because a
// `tool:` trigger may name any tool and an alternation would decide in
// `hooks.json` which memories can ever fire. The installed CLI answers a
// matcher of `*` before it compiles anything: its hook dispatch answers true
// for an absent matcher, for `*` and for `.*` alike, and only then builds a
// RegExp from the matcher text, so the value is a match-all rather than an
// invalid pattern (2.1.251). `*` is chosen out of that set because the CLI's
// own test names it first.
// The two lifecycle registrations carry no matcher, for two different reasons.
// At `SubagentStart` that is a CHOICE: the installed CLI does support a matcher
// there, its event table giving that event a matcher over the `agent_type`
// field, and a matcher would decide in `hooks.json` which agent types this
// boundary can ever fire on, which is the same objection the tool registrations
// answer with `*`. At `UserPromptSubmit` it is the EVENT'S OWN NATURE: that
// event's table entry carries no matcher at all, there being nothing on a prompt
// turn to match against.
//
// MATCHING HERE IS TRIGGER-AND-LEXICAL, and two independent rules keep it
// there. They are stated separately because they answer different questions and
// neither one implies the other.
//
// Semantic matching against the store's own embeddings is DEFERRED rather than
// refused. It is Tier 2 of the recognition design, gated by decision 2 of
// `docs/archive/claude-kit_memory-recognition_spec_v1.md` on a stamp-rate
// reading showing that declared nudges get acted on at all, and this hook's own
// nudge log is what feeds that reading. So a future version of this file may
// carry it, once the evidence the gate names exists.
//
// No endpoint call is made from these boundaries whatever Tier 2 turns out to
// be. These registrations are synchronous and sit in front of every prompt and
// every tool call, so seconds of latency here are seconds on every turn a
// session takes, on a path whose entire product is one line the model may
// ignore. The endpoint path is the sidecar daemon's, asynchronous by design,
// which is where a slow answer costs nobody a turn. That is a property of the
// channel rather than of the matching, which is why it holds for a semantic
// tier as well: the store's embedder is in-process and needs no endpoint.
//
// HOW EACH TYPE MATCHES, stated per type rather than once for all six,
// because the vocabulary is typed and a rule true of one member is not
// automatically true of the others:
//
//   cmd    containment, against the call's command string. A cmd pattern is a
//          fragment of a longer command line by construction.
//   err    containment, against the call's failure output. Same reason.
//   glob   the segment matcher below, against each path the call touched. A
//          glob is a fragment of a path, matched at any segment boundary so
//          `plugins/x/*` fires on the absolute path a payload carries.
//   skill  equality, against the skill the call invokes. The pattern is the
//          whole identifier, so containment would fire `skill:memory` on
//          `memory-system` and there is no longer spelling to disambiguate.
//   agent  equality, against the agent type the call dispatches.
//   tool   equality, against the call's tool name. `tool:Bash` names Bash and
//          not BashOutput, which containment cannot express.
//
// That table is the tool boundaries' rule, where a call carries typed fields
// and an identifier has a field of its own to be compared against. A PROMPT
// HAS NO SUCH FIELDS: it is one blob of free text, so at UserPromptSubmit the
// fragment types keep containment against that text and the three identifier
// types match on a WHOLE TOKEN instead, the identifier having to stand as its
// own word rather than merely appear somewhere in a sentence. Whichever
// reading a type takes, it reaches that boundary from the project tier alone,
// and from no tier at all while a store pin is in effect: a prompt is prose
// rather than a field, so any match against it is a guess about what the
// words mean, and memq's authoring bars screen a pattern against a command
// line or a failure's output while neither one says anything about English.
// What admits a tier there is confinement to one checkout, which a
// KIT_MEMORY_PROJECT pin dissolves by serving every repository the instance
// works in; see collectHits.
//
// Neither of the two obvious alternatives works there. Equality would make
// `skill:`, `agent:` and `tool:` unmatchable at that boundary rather than
// stricter, since a prompt naming a skill names it inside a sentence. Bare
// containment turns a stored identifier into a substring matcher over English:
// the pattern floor is four characters, so `tool:Read` is admissible and would
// fire on "thread", "already", "readme" and "spread", and `tool:Edit` on
// "credit". That is not the cheap kind of false positive this file usually
// trades for, because the per-session dedup then spends the trigger on the
// false positive and the true firing never arrives, so a loose match here
// DISARMS the recognition rather than merely adding a line to it. The token
// rule keeps the sentence case matching and takes the sub-word case away.
// SubagentStart keeps equality, its subject being an identifier field and
// nothing else.
//
// The split is exactly memq's own TRIGGER_FRAGMENT_TYPES: a fragment type
// matches by containment wherever it is matched, and an identifier type by the
// strictest comparison its subject admits, equality against a field and a whole
// token against free text. memq's authoring gate is calibrated on that same
// split, applying its bare-common-token bar to the fragment types alone because
// an identifier pattern "is the whole of what there is", which is a bar that
// assumes whole values are what get compared. Every comparison folds case. A
// command's own casing is not what makes it specific (memq's bare-token bar
// folds case for that reason), PowerShell is case-insensitive about its own
// verbs, and a missed nudge costs more here than a loose one wherever a loose
// one really is just a line the model ignores.
//
// FILE ANCHORS are read for their PATHS, with the sha ignored. An anchor's
// sha is load-bearing for drift detection, which is a different question
// asked by a different surface; here the anchor says which files the record
// is about, and a record whose anchored file has since changed is if anything
// the more worth surfacing. The match is a path suffix (the anchor path is
// repo-relative and the payload's is absolute), which also keeps a linked
// worktree's session matching records whose anchors were hashed against the
// main checkout.
//
// WHAT ONE CALL MAY SPEND. Three bounds hold the per-call cost, and they are
// three because each closes a different way for a stored record to make this
// hook expensive:
//   - MATCH_OPS_MAX bounds the whole matrix of triggers against subjects, not
//     one pattern against one subject. The per-pair matcher being linear is
//     necessary and not sufficient: the declared shapes admit hundreds of
//     records times dozens of triggers times sixteen paths, and a bound on
//     each pair says nothing about their product.
//   - The window cap and the dedup set are consulted BEFORE the matrix runs,
//     so a session that has spent its budget, or that has already been told
//     about a trigger, pays a marker read rather than a match.
//   - INDEX_SERIALIZED_CAP bounds the index itself, at build time, so the
//     cached form always fits the reader's ceiling.
//
// THE INDEX AND ITS CACHE. Each hook invocation is its own process, so an
// index held in a variable would die with the call that built it. It is held
// in a cache file instead, one per tier, keyed by the memory directory it was
// built from and stamped with that directory's state (every record's name,
// size and mtime). A stamp that still matches is a lookup; one that has moved
// rebuilds. That makes the per-call cost a listing plus a stat per record
// rather than a read and a frontmatter parse per record, and it is paid once
// per tier the call reaches rather than once: three tiers are three listings
// and three stamps, with no budget shared between them, so the ceiling is the
// sum of the tiers' record counts rather than one tier's. The operator tier is
// the one that grows without a project to bound it, being written by every
// project on the machine. The stamp is
// per-file rather than the directory's own mtime because the common way a
// trigger changes is an edit to a record that already exists, which never
// moves the directory's mtime.
//
// The cache and the session markers live in one kit-owned directory under the
// temp directory, created 0700 and refused unless it is a real directory this
// user owns with no group or other access. A fixed name under a shared temp
// directory is state anybody on the machine can arrange in advance, which is
// the rule hook-canary.js states against itself; the ownership screen plus an
// exclusive create and a rename for every write is what makes a fixed name
// safe to use here. Nothing is ever written through an existing path: a write
// creates its temp file with the exclusive flag, so a link or a file already
// standing at that name fails the write instead of being written through.
//
// The cache is read back as untrusted text even so: its stamp must match,
// every record name in it must be one memq would admit, every trigger must
// still satisfy memq's own grammar, and every anchor path must satisfy the
// anchor path grammar, with each record's trigger and anchor counts bounded
// by the same figures the build path enforces. Anything else rebuilds from
// the store. And nothing the cache says reaches a session unverified: before
// a nudge is emitted, the record is read from the store and the trigger the
// nudge names must still be declared in it, so both halves of the line are
// the store's own text rather than the cache's.
//
// THE INDEX SPANS EVERY TIER THIS PROJECT REACHES: the project tier, the
// declared type tier where the project declares one and it exists, and the
// operator tier where the store has one. A trigger is a pattern rather than a
// path, so it is portable in a way an anchor is not, and a lesson banked once
// on a machine-wide tier is a lesson every project on that machine can be met
// with. Each tier is loaded, stamped and cached on its own, so an absent or
// unreadable tier costs nothing but itself and the other two still nudge.
//
// The pending tier stays excluded, which the listing does by reading files
// rather than descending: an unadjudicated write from one run must never nudge
// another session, matching `find`'s own exclusion of the pending tier from
// the semantic index.
//
// A hit carries its tier from here to the end, and every place a record was
// keyed on name alone now keys on tier and name together: the dedup key, the
// one-nudge-per-record rule inside a claim, and the re-read that confirms the
// store still declares what the nudge says. Two tiers holding a record of the
// same name hold two different facts, so a key without the tier would let
// whichever matched first silence the other for the whole session. A hit
// outside the project tier says which tier it came from on its own line, since
// `memq get <name>` resolves by precedence and a bare name would point at the
// nearer record rather than the one that matched.
//
// THE DEDUP IS PER SESSION, PER RECIPIENT AND PER BOUNDARY CLASS, and the two
// halves past the session are there because a session id answers neither
// question a dedup is actually about: which context the line lands in, and which
// moment it is about.
//
// The RECIPIENT, because a subagent shares its parent's session id byte for
// byte. Keyed on the session alone, the dedup answers whether this SESSION has
// been told, when what decides a nudge's worth is whether the context the line
// lands in has been told. Those come apart at exactly one boundary. An
// orchestrator calling the Agent tool nudges at PreToolUse into its own context,
// and the subagent it starts nudges at SubagentStart into a context that
// inherits nothing, no session-start index and no nudge the parent received; a
// session-keyed dedup would suppress the second on the strength of the first,
// and since `agent` is the only type SubagentStart matches, that suppression is
// the whole boundary rather than one case of it. So the key carries the agent id
// at that boundary and nothing at the other three, where the recipient IS the
// session.
//
// The BOUNDARY CLASS, because the same pattern found at two moments is two
// different facts, and the looser of the two arrives first by construction. A
// prompt matches `cmd:` and `err:` by containment against prose, so a prompt
// saying "do not use rm -rf here" claims `cmd:rm -rf` at the top of the turn,
// and the real `rm -rf` call later in the session would read as a repeat of it.
// What that disarms is the pre-boundary this file's header calls the place a
// memory about a destructive command can still be acted on. The class has three
// members: `tool`, `prompt` and `dispatch`. The two tool boundaries share one
// class because their type vocabularies are disjoint, so no key either one mints
// can collide with the other's.
//
// For the three IDENTIFIER types the same key buys a second delivery instead,
// and that is deliberate rather than the rule's blind spot. A prompt naming a
// skill, an agent type or a tool and the call that carries it are the same fact
// matched twice, so the record's pointer lands twice in one turn's context. The
// second delivery is the price of the fragment case's protection, since the
// alternative folds the two moments for every type and disarms the pre-boundary
// above, and it is a price the pointer form makes small: one line naming a
// record, arriving once while the approach is still being chosen and once as the
// call is about to run.
//
// What both cost is marker keys, bounded by MARKER_KEYS_MAX for the classes the
// session receives and by MARKER_DISPATCH_KEYS_MAX for the recipient-keyed one.
//
// PRECISION, and why it is a lock rather than a read and a write. Three
// mechanisms ship with the matcher: once per trigger per session, per recipient
// and per boundary class; a boundary's own cap, spent inside its own window at
// the three boundaries a window means anything at (see windowFields); and the
// pointer-only form. All three
// live in one per-session marker, and this harness issues tool calls in
// parallel, so several copies of this hook read and write that marker at
// once. A plain read-modify-write there is last-writer-wins: every copy sees
// room, every copy emits, and the fired keys of all but one are lost, which
// is the cap and the dedup both defeated in exactly the batch they exist for.
// So the decision runs inside memq's own lockfile, and a copy that cannot
// take the lock inside a short wait emits nothing. The marker write also
// precedes delivery: a marker that cannot be written stands the nudge down,
// because the marker is what enforces the cap and emitting without it is how
// a hook that runs on every tool call becomes noise.
//
// THE NUDGE LOG. Every nudge this hook actually emits is also appended, one
// line per record named, to a machine-local log under the project's own
// .kit/ (gitignored, never synced): the record, the tier it was matched in,
// the trigger that fired, and the moment. The tier rides beside the name
// because a record name is unique inside a tier and not across them, and the
// reading below joins the log against one tier's stamps.
// It is what makes the experiment readable rather than merely
// felt: memory-system/SKILL.md's stamp-rate protocol joins this log against
// the store's own applied stamps to read whether a nudged record gets used
// at a higher rate than an unnudged one, which is the evidence decision 2's
// semantic-tier gate consumes. The log is bounded and rotates past 1 MB in
// the same shape emitGoalEvent's own event stream does, and its absence, like
// an empty store's, reads as no nudge has fired yet rather than as a fault.
// Appending to it is best-effort exactly like every other write in this file
// and never changes what the session receives.
//
// SAFETY: this hook never blocks and never modifies a call. There is no deny
// path in this file. Its whole output channel is one JSON object on stdout at
// exit 0 whose hookSpecificOutput carries the boundary's own hookEventName
// and additionalContext (a TOP-LEVEL additionalContext key is inert on this
// harness, so none is emitted). Every failure inside it is silence: an
// unreadable store, an absent memory directory, a malformed record, a memq
// missing a symbol, a network-shaped working directory or store root, a
// payload that does not parse.
//
// Neither channel carries anything but that one answer. Everything loaded
// here writes through the same fence memory-frontmatter-guard.js raises, and
// for the same reason on each channel. memq notes an ignored KIT_MEMORY_ROOT
// or KIT_MEMORY_PROJECT on stderr once per process, and this hook runs at both
// boundaries of every tool call, in front of every prompt and at every dispatch,
// so an unfenced note would repeat on every one of them in a session that sets
// either variable without its gate. stdout is the harder case: the harness reads
// that channel as JSON and drops the
// whole object if any other byte shares it, so one line written there by
// anything loaded here turns the nudge into no answer at all. This hook's own
// write goes out through fs.writeSync on the descriptor, which is under the
// fence rather than over it.
//
// The network-shaped path is not a general caution but this hook's own hazard
// class, and it is asked of two paths. The working directory: resolving the
// memory directory from cwd reaches worktreeMainRoot's fs.statSync on cwd's
// .git, the synchronous walk that blocks for the SMB timeout when the host is
// unreachable, which is the gate memq's own verbs carry and whose mechanism
// cmdLog's hoist names. And the store root: this hook lists that directory
// and stats every record in it on every call, so a store root on an
// unreachable share stalls every tool call in the session for the same
// timeout, a walk no cwd screen can see. A store pin answers the project
// segment before the cwd walk is reached, which is why the cwd gate asks both
// questions in memq's own order; no pin takes the root's own shape away, so
// the root is screened unconditionally.
//
// Store text reaching the nudge (a record's name, a trigger's pattern) is
// reduced through memq.sanitize and capped, and the nudge says the text is
// repo data rather than instructions, the same posture the sibling nudges
// hold for the values they carry.

//   - CJK Symbols and Punctuation, U+3000-U+303F: the ideographic space, comma
//     and full stop and the corner brackets, which is the punctuation of the
//     writing system the letters half of this rule is admitted for.
//   - Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms, U+FF00-U+FFEF: the fullwidth spellings of
//     the ASCII punctuation, which a CJK keyboard produces by default.
//   - The surrogates, U+D800-U+DFFF: an astral character arrives here as two
//     surrogate halves, each above ASCII and neither a letter, so an emoji
//     written straight against an identifier would otherwise join it.
//   - The singletons outside those blocks: the no-break space, the soft hyphen,
//     the two guillemets and the byte-order mark.
//
// The test is arithmetic rather than a Unicode property class because this runs
// per character on a path in front of every prompt and every tool call, where

// `tool:Read` a token it does not have; the exclusion is there because the same
// range carries the punctuation, the separators and the surrogate halves an
// emoji arrives as, and reading one of those as a letter refuses a true match on
// prose an autocorrect or a paste touched.
//
// A JOINER is a hyphen or a dot, and it is a token character exactly when it
// joins, meaning the character on its far side is a word character. That is the
// whole of the difference between `read-only` and `notes.bash.md`, which are

// let whichever one matched first mark the other as already said for the rest
// of the session.
//
// `recipient` is WHO the nudge would reach, and it is part of the key for the
// same reason the tier is: what a dedup is about is the record and the context
// the pointer lands in together, never the record alone. It is '' at three of
// the four boundaries, where the recipient is the session the marker is already
// keyed on. At SubagentStart it is the starting agent's own id, because
// that injection lands in the SUBAGENT's context rather than in the session's:
// a subagent shares its parent's session id byte for byte, so without the
// recipient the orchestrator's own PreToolUse nudge about the very dispatch it
// is making suppresses the subagent's, and a subagent inherits no memory
// context by any other route, which is the whole reason that boundary is wired.
// A dispatch payload carrying no agent id falls back to '' and keeps the old
// suppression, which is this file's fail-toward-silence posture rather than a
// second rule.
//
// `boundaryClass` is WHICH MOMENT the nudge is about, and it is in the key
// because the same pattern found at two moments is two facts rather than a
// repeat. The looser subject arrives first by construction: a prompt matches
// `cmd:` and `err:` by containment against prose, so a prompt merely naming a
// destructive command claims that trigger at the top of the turn, and the call
// that really runs it would read as already said. What that disarms is the
// pre-boundary this file's header calls the place a memory about a destructive
// command can still be acted on. The class has three members, `tool`, `prompt`
// and `dispatch`, the two tool boundaries sharing one because their type
// vocabularies are disjoint and neither can mint a key the other could.
//
// The identifier types are the other half of that trade, and the second delivery
// they buy is deliberate. For `skill:`, `agent:` and `tool:` a prompt naming the
// identifier and the call that carries it are the same fact matched twice, so
// the record's pointer lands twice in one turn's context. That is the price of
// the fragment case's protection rather than an oversight, and it is the price
// worth paying: the prompt-time pointer arrives while the approach is still
// being chosen, and the call still earns its own at the moment it is about to
// run. Folding the two would have to fold them for every type, which is what

// The evidence decision 2's gate reads: the stamp rate of nudged project-tier
// records against unnudged ones, over a stated window. Not a hook boundary;
// this is the reading protocol memory-system/SKILL.md points at, run by hand
// or from a short script at the moment the semantic tier's gate is being
// asked.
//
// The report is the project tier's, where the nudge itself now spans three:
// every arm is drawn from the project tier's own listing and index, and a log
// line naming another tier is skipped rather than joined, so the number
// answers about one population read one way. Widening it is a separate
// question, since a shared tier's applied stamps are written by every project
// on the machine while this log holds one project's nudges.
//
// "Nudged" is every record the project's index carries a trigger or anchor
// for (the same "declared" gate a nudge itself must pass) that the project's
// nudge log names at least once with ts >= sinceMs on a line delivered into the
// session; "dispatched" is every such record the log names only on lines
// delivered into a dispatched agent's context; "unnudged" is every other
// such record, excluding one the tier holds but that carries no trigger or
// anchor at all, since that record could never have earned a nudge and is not
// a fair control for one that could. "Stamped" is an applied stamp on that
// record whose most recent evidence (appliedTally's lastMs) falls no earlier
// than the record's own first nudge for the nudged group, or no earlier than
// sinceMs for the unnudged group, so a record nudged for the first time near
// the end of the window is not charged for having failed to earn a stamp in
// time it was never given. A record this hook could nudge but that decayed
// out of the tier since is counted in neither group: the comparison is asked
// of the tier as it stands now.
//
// This number cannot, by itself, distinguish "the nudge caused the
// application" from "the records worth nudging are the ones already relevant
// to current work, which get applied more regardless of whether they are
// nudged." A nudge only fires on a record carrying a declared trigger or
// anchor that matched something the session just did, so the nudged group is
// already selected for topical relevance before the comparison starts; a
// materially higher nudged rate is evidence consistent with the nudge
// working, not proof of it. memory-system/SKILL.md states this plainly beside
// the reading itself, because the number does not carry its own caveat.
//
// Returns { since, nudged: {total, stamped, rate}, dispatched: {...},
// unnudged: {...} }, three arms over one population: a record the log names on a
// session-delivered line, one it names only on a dispatch-delivered line, and
// one it does not name at all. The middle arm is separate because a pointer
// delivered into a dispatched agent's context reached a reader that ends with
// the dispatch, so it is neither a fair control nor evidence about the channel
// the gate is being asked about. Rate is null rather than NaN where total is 0.
// The answer is instead
// { error: <cause> } for the same reasons main() would fail open: an
// unloadable memq, a network-shaped cwd or store root, a project memory
// directory that cannot be resolved, or a usage sidecar this process could
// not read (as opposed to one that has simply never been written). Three more
// are this report's own, and all three are a bound that would shorten one
// side of the comparison without saying so: a tier listing this hook's
// per-call cap cut short, an index its byte bounds cut short, and a nudge log
// past the read bound, whose cut takes the newest lines and so the most
// recent nudges. Each is refused rather than silently understated, because a
// number that flatters the feature it gates is worse than no number.
// sinceMs is required, because a report with no stated window is exactly the
