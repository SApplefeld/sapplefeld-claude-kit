# The doctor's memory-sync helpers: what the sync repo's allowlist is, what
# the store root's actual state is against it, and how an initialization is
# performed.
#
# Dot-sourced by doctor.ps1, which calls these under its "memory sync" check;
# the repo test suite dot-sources the same file and runs the same functions
# against a redirected store root, which is why the store root arrives as a
# mandatory parameter and is never resolved from the environment here. There
# is no default: the real store root holds .credentials.json, settings.json,
# and history.jsonl, so a forgotten redirect must be a loud parameter error
# rather than a git init over the operator's home. This file defines
# functions only; dot-sourcing it runs nothing and writes nothing.
#
# The store root is ~/.claude itself, and the allowlist is the whole security
# model of the sync: it excludes everything and re-includes only the memory
# tiers and the coordinator directory, so no add, however careless, can stage
# a credential. The canonical text of both files is defined once here and used
# by both the writer and the check, so the check cannot drift from what the
# installer writes, and the check re-derives it on every doctor run rather than
# trusting a one-time verification.
#
# Verification is by direct probe, never by reading the ignore file alone.
# Each probe reads a different surface, and none of them substitutes for
# another: `git check-ignore` reads the rules, `git add -A --dry-run` reads the
# worktree, `git ls-files` reads the index, and `git rev-list --objects` reads
# the reachable object graph. A tracked file ignores gitignore entirely and
# appears in neither of the first two, so a single forced add would otherwise
# be invisible against a canonical-looking allowlist; and a blob that reached
# a commit stays reachable after it is untracked, so the history probe is the
# only one that can see a credential a push would still publish.
#
# A managed file carrying the marker line is the doctor's own and may be
# rewritten back to canonical; a file without it belongs to whoever wrote it
# and is reported, never touched. Repository ownership is a separate question
# and rests on a git config key set at initialization, so a repository whose
# .gitignore was deleted is still recognizable as the doctor's own and stays
# repairable; a marker-bearing .gitignore is accepted as equivalent evidence.

# The line both managed files open with, and the only thing that makes a file
# on disk this script's to rewrite.

# The file forms an admitted root holds, keyed on the prefix that root's block
# in the ignore file takes. One set is defined per root and every surface that
# needs one reads it from here, so git, the probes, and the merge attributes
# cannot answer differently about a form. The switch carries one arm per root
# and a default that throws, so a root added to the prefix list below, or to
# either surface, and not to an arm here is a thrown error rather than another
# root's forms silently. Which callers surface that error differs, and the
# difference matters: the doctor and the repo suite let it out, where
# sync-store.ps1 runs Get-MemorySyncStatus inside a try whose tail catch is
# bare and whose contract is silence, so on the automatic sync path the throw
# is swallowed and the state file keeps whatever it last held. The check that
# actually stops a root being added to one surface and not another is the
# suite's drift pin over these three lists, not this throw.
#
# The forms differ per root because what writes into each root differs, and a
# form no writer of a root produces is a form that root does not re-include.
#
# The project tier holds the whole of what memq writes: memory bodies and both
# indexes as .md, the outcome journal, the usage sidecar, and the decay pass's
# completion stamp as the extension-less decay-stamp. The journal and the
# stamp are per-project by construction, both of their writers resolving
# through projectMemoryDir, so this is the only root that holds them. The
# run-scoped pending tier sits two levels below this root, under pending/
# <run-id>, and its own usage sidecar takes the same name, which the
# surrounding /**/ reaches at any depth.
#
# The type and operator tiers are shared, and the only memq output written
# into them is the usage sidecar: read stamps, the stamp rewrite a delete
# takes, and the decay pass's usage step all run against a tier directory,
# while the journal's writers and the decay stamp's do not. So those two roots
# admit .md and usage.jsonl and nothing else.
#
# Both sidecars are admitted by name rather than by extension, because a
# re-include written as an extension admits every .jsonl any tool writes
# anywhere under a root, whatever its relationship to the store.
#
# The coordinator directory holds no memq output at all: its contract names
# four files, the board, the registry entries, the claim file, and the Admin
# request inbox, and all four are .md. Its set is still a form rather than
# that contract, and so is wider than it: .md at any depth under any
# directory there is admitted, where the contract names four paths. What the
# form buys is that it is the one form the contract writes, rather than a
# form no writer of that root produces. A coordinator .jsonl or stamp is a
# widening this function performs by name at the moment that contract defines
# one.
#
# Everything else an admitted directory can hold (locks, the single-generation
# .bak, rename temporaries, a broken-lock rename such as decay.lock.stale.<pid>)
# is transient state of one machine and never syncs.

#
# Every GIT_* variable is removed, case-insensitively. None is needed, since
# each call names its repository with -C, and several of them beat what the
# arguments say (GIT_DIR and GIT_WORK_TREE redirect the repository,
# GIT_CONFIG_* injects arbitrary config, the identity variables rewrite
# authorship).
#
# GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT refuses a credential prompt, so a run with no operator
# at the keyboard fails with a diagnosable error instead of blocking on a
# hidden dialog.
#
# NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath is defence in depth for anything git
# spawns through a shell (an alias, a credential helper): cmd.exe reads that
# variable from its own environment and then resolves a bare command name
# against PATH alone rather than against the current directory.
#
# core.fsmonitor and core.hooksPath are ordinary repo-local keys git honours
# on an ordinary read, so a status against a wrong or planted store root runs
# that repository's code. Both are pinned inert through git's
# environment-config channel, which beats repo-local config. The pins are
# additive rather than a suppression of the config files: pointing
# GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL at an empty file would also drop safe.directory, whose
# absence surfaces as a dubious-ownership refusal that reads like a
# permissions bug. fsmonitor is pinned to false, git's own disable value for
# the key, because a Windows process environment cannot hold an empty value
# (the setter deletes the variable instead) and a GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_<i> absent
# while GIT_CONFIG_COUNT names it is a fatal parse error on every call.
# hooksPath points at a fresh path under the temp directory that nothing
# creates, so git finds no hooks to run.
#
# The variables are snapshotted and restored in a finally block, so the
# session that dot-sources this file keeps its own environment whether git
# succeeded, failed, or threw. The exit code is read before the restore,
# since the restore is itself PowerShell work that would overwrite it.

# reported as work to do rather than as a passing allowlist.
#
# ProbesAttempted and ProbesAnswered count the four leak probes, so a caller
# can say how much of the negative was actually proven. An empty result set
# means nothing on its own: it reads identically whether a probe found nothing
# or never ran.
#
# Dirty is a fifth, separate fact from the four leak probes: whether the
# worktree holds a change under the allowlist that has not been committed yet
# (a memory the session wrote this run, most commonly). It is not folded into
# ProbesAttempted/ProbesAnswered, because those count how much of the security
# negative was proven and Dirty proves nothing about leaks; a git status call
# that fails leaves Dirty false rather than marking the whole status unproven,
# the same fail-quiet posture the session hook's own sync trigger
# takes on the identical git call. `--untracked-files=all` is what keeps
# DirtyCount an exact file count rather than one line for a whole new
# untracked directory, which git's default porcelain output would collapse to.
