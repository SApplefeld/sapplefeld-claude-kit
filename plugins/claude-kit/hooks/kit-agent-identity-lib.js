// Shared predicate: does a hook payload belong to a subagent's tool call?
//
// A subagent's payload carries the PARENT session's `session_id`, byte for byte,
// so no session-id test can tell one from a main-thread call. The agent-identity
// keys can, and every hook that must not act inside a subagent asks the same
// question of the same five spellings. The breadth is the point: the cost of
// reading one key too many is a main-session call misread as a subagent's on a
// harness that never sends it, and the cost of reading one too few is a whole
// class of subagent calls invisible to every detector at once.
//
// This is its own module, holding that question and the policy class of an agent
// type and nothing else, for the reason
// hooks/kit-network-lib.js states for its own predicate: a hot hook path cannot
// pay a large module's load to answer one question, and a hook that reached into
// a sibling hook for the answer would be taken down silently by any failure
// inside that sibling. Four hooks ask this question on a per-tool-call boundary,
// and one hand-copied set that gains a spelling in three places out of four is a
// leak nothing detects: the sites that kept the old set simply keep answering.
//
// FOUR READINGS, because the call sites genuinely need four and this module
// exists to unify the key set rather than to flatten behaviour that differs on
// purpose:
//
//   agentIdentity      the first truthy value, or null. The caller that wants
//                      to know WHICH identity it saw.
//   isSubagentCall     the same reading as a boolean.
//   carriesAgentKey    presence rather than truthiness, for the caller whose
//                      stand-down is deliberately the wider one.
//   dispatchedAgentId  the agent id alone, as a string, deliberately narrower
//                      than all three. `agent_type` rides on the MAIN thread of
//                      a session started with --agent, so a boundary that stood
//                      down on the wider reading would be dead from that
//                      session's first prompt onward with nothing reporting it.
//                      An agent id is the one key present when and only when the
//                      payload belongs to a dispatched agent.
//
//                      It reads ONE spelling, `agent_id`, and the breadth this
//                      module exists for is dropped here on purpose rather than
//                      omitted. The CLI's payload schema documents `agent_id` as
//                      the key absent on the main thread even in an --agent
//                      session, which is precisely the distinction being drawn,
//                      so a second spelling folded in would have to carry that
//                      same property to be an answer to the same question, and a
//                      type spelling does not. Where the key set above is broad
//                      because a missed spelling costs a whole class of
//                      subagent calls, a wrong spelling here costs the feature
//                      the caller is standing down from.
//
// TWO KEY LISTS, because identity and subject are two questions. AGENT_KEYS
// answers "was this payload produced by an agent", which is what an id or a type
// spelling on it says. AGENT_TYPE_KEYS answers "what type of agent is this
// payload about", which is the dispatch subject a recognition trigger is matched
// against: it drops `agent_id`, an instance rather than a type, and carries the
// bare `type` a dispatch payload may spell.
//
// Truthiness is the reading most callers take. A harness emitting a null or
// empty `agent_id` on every main-session payload would otherwise stand those
// hooks down on every call and retire their features outright, which is a
// failure nothing would report; presence is the stricter reading, and a caller
// takes it when standing down too often is the cheaper of its two errors.
//
// A non-object answers "no identity" rather than throwing: every caller here
// runs inside a hook that must never disturb the session it observes, and each
// one screens the payload's shape on its own account before it gets this far.
