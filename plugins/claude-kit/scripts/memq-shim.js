// memq shim: the stable entry point for memq. Doctor -Fix copies this file to
// ~/.claude/bin/memq-shim.js beside one wrapper per shell that resolves a
// command differently (memq.ps1 for PowerShell, memq.cmd for cmd, an
// extensionless sh script for Git Bash), so `memq` resolves in every shell
// while the real memq.js stays inside the installed plugin payload.
// install-memq-shim.ps1 beside the doctor owns those wrappers and explains
// why PowerShell gets its own.
//
// The payload's cache path carries the release version
// (~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/claude-kit/<version>/), so a path
// baked in at install time rots at the next kit update. This shim bakes in
// nothing: every invocation re-resolves the installed payload and runs its
// scripts/memq.js, so a kit update needs no doctor re-run; only a first
// install or a moved ~/.claude does. Changes to memq.js ride the plugin cache
// automatically; changes to this file reach a machine at the next -Fix.
//
// Resolution order, first hit wins:
//   1. installed_plugins.json in the plugins directory: the harness's own
//      record of the active install. Running the payload the harness runs
//      beats running a newer cache entry the harness has not activated.
//   2. The newest cache entry for the kit (by directory mtime), restricted to
//      the marketplace the manifest names when it names one. This is the
//      fallback when the manifest is absent, unparseable, shaped differently
//      by a harness update, or pointing at a path that no longer holds the
//      script.
// An entry counts only when scripts/memq.js actually exists in it, so a
// half-removed cache directory is never chosen. Marketplace is part of a
// payload's identity, not decoration: a second marketplace can carry a
// directory named claude-kit, and this resolver decides which JavaScript
// runs, so the manifest's marketplace pins the scan, and a scan with no
// manifest to pin it notes on stderr when more than one marketplace offers a
// candidate. Ordering is total (mtime, then marketplace, then version), so
// two runs against one unchanged store always pick the same entry.
//
// When nothing resolves, the exit is 1 with a note naming the fix; every
// other outcome is memq's own, with its exit code and stdio passed straight
// through.
//
// KIT_PLUGINS_ROOT replaces ~/.claude/plugins as the directory searched, and
// is honored only when KIT_PLUGINS_ROOT_ALLOW_CODE=1 is also set; otherwise
// it is ignored with a stderr note. Two signals rather than one because this
// variable selects executable code: memq resolves from PATH inside whatever
// repository a session is working in, and a single innocuous-looking
// variable is settable from a committed file a repository already has
// (.vscode/settings.json's terminal env, devcontainer.json, .envrc).
// KIT_MEMORY_ROOT in scripts/memq.js carries the same two-signal gate under
// its own second signal (KIT_MEMORY_ROOT_ALLOW_DATA), and the two are not
// one rule restated: this root selects which program runs, that one selects
// which data reaches the model's context, and each power warrants its own
// gate, so neither may be loosened to match a weaker reading of the other.
// The intended use of both pairs is the repo test suite, which sets them
// all. Every one of these variables passes through to the spawned memq
// untouched (the environment is inherited whole); memq reads the memory pair
// and ignores the plugins pair.
//
// Node core modules only, CommonJS, zero dependencies, UTF-8 throughout. That
// last constraint is why the two failure notes below name no path. Both values
// they would otherwise carry are home-anchored (the plugins directory sits
// under ~/.claude, and the payload inside it), and this shim's output is read
// by a model, so taking the OS account name out of them is the shared
// renderer's job. The renderer lives in the kit payload, which is exactly what
// this file has failed to find or to run whenever either note fires, and the
// installed copy of this file sits in ~/.claude/bin/ outside every payload, so
// there is nothing beside it to load either. The paths are withheld and the
// remedy named in their place.
