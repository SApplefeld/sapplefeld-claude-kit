// Shared git runner for the kit's hooks. Every git invocation a hook makes runs
// through here, so the two properties that make a naive spawn unsafe are closed
// in one place instead of at each call site.
//
// The spawn's working directory is this file's own directory, never the
// repository being asked about. On Windows a bare command name is resolved
// against the spawn's working directory BEFORE the system PATH, unless the
// spawning process carries NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath, which a session
// launched from a shortcut, from PowerShell, or from Windows Terminal does not.
// An MSYS2 shell such as Git Bash does set it, which is why a probe run from one
// comes back clean and the clean reading is the shell rather than the code. A
// repository
// carrying a file named git.exe therefore runs its own binary the moment a hook
// asks that directory a question, and the kit's SessionStart hooks fire
// unattended on startup, resume and compaction in whatever directory the
// session opened, including a clone of this public repo nobody has read. The
// hooks directory closes that route without inventing a new trust assumption:
// anyone able to write there already controls the code being run. An unset
// working directory does not close it, because a hook process's own working
// directory is the project directory.
//
// The child environment carries no GIT_* variable. GIT_DIR, GIT_WORK_TREE and
// GIT_COMMON_DIR make git answer about a repository other than the one named,
// and GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL and its siblings make it read an attacker-supplied
// config, so an ambient environment (a session started from a repo-carried
// terminal profile) would otherwise decide what a hook reports. The strip is
// wholesale and case-insensitive, since Windows environment keys are not the
// casing a plain-object copy is indexed by, and GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT is set
// after it so no invocation can block a session on a credential prompt. The
// only GIT_* names the child carries are the guard's own: the prompt refusal
// and the environment-config pins that hold core.fsmonitor and core.hooksPath
// inert. Those two pins close two named routes by which a repository nobody
// has vetted runs its own code on a read; the class is wider than the two,
// and gitChildEnv's comment names what stays open.
//
// The boundary is shared rather than per-caller because an unexported one is
// the fix the next author reimplements by not implementing it: both properties
// belong to the channel every hook's git calls run through, not to the one
// caller that first needed them.
//
// Node core modules only, CommonJS, zero dependencies. Nothing here throws: git
// absent, a spawn error, a nonzero exit, or a run past the timeout all degrade
// to a null or to a status the caller reads, matching kit-goal-lib.js.

// GIT_* key removed case-insensitively, plus the terminal-prompt refusal and
// the two config pins below. None of the stripped variables is needed, since
// every call below passes `-C <repoDir>` to name the repository it means.
//
// core.fsmonitor and core.hooksPath are ordinary repo-local keys git honours,
// so a status against a wrong or planted repository runs its fsmonitor
// program and a commit runs its hooks, and the hooks here ask exactly those
// questions of whatever directory a session opened in. Both are pinned inert
// through git's environment-config channel, which beats repo-local config. The
// pins are additive rather than a suppression of the config files: pointing
// GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL at an empty file would also drop safe.directory, whose
// absence surfaces as a dubious-ownership refusal that reads like a permissions
// bug. fsmonitor takes git's own disable value rather than an empty string,
// because a Windows process environment cannot hold an empty value and a
// GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_<i> absent while GIT_CONFIG_COUNT names it is a fatal parse
// error on every call. hooksPath names a fresh path under the temp directory
// that nothing creates, so git finds no hooks to run. Both are set after the
// strip, so an ambient GIT_CONFIG_COUNT cannot displace them. The channel
// exists in git 2.31 and later; an older git ignores it silently and this
// guard degrades to the strip alone, with nothing here to say so.
//
// Two keys are pinned by name, and the class they belong to is not closed:
// any key git documents as a command or program, and any remote URL scheme or
// helper a remote's config selects, also makes git run a command on the verbs
// the hooks use. The one write-shaped verb here is branch-reaper-nudge's
// fetch against whatever repository a session opened, where a repo-local
// core.sshCommand, credential.helper or upload-pack setting runs under these
// pins exactly as before them. So the coverage is the two named members
// rather than the class. The hooksPath pin also reaches an operator's global
// hooks, since the environment channel cannot tell a repo-local hooksPath
// from a global one; on the read verbs here that costs nothing. HOME and
// XDG_CONFIG_HOME are not stripped, since git needs HOME for its legitimate
// config, so they still select the global config every guarded call reads;
// docs/security-model.md carries that residual.
//
// The same two pins are spelled again in Invoke-MemorySyncGit
// (doctor/install-memory-sync.ps1), which guards the sync script's own git
// calls. Neither language can call the other's, so the protections are
// restated there rather than shared.
