// PreToolUse guard: the state under review is not the reviewer's to change.
//
// The kit's access model, by agent class:
//   Strict (adversarial-reviewer, blind-reviewer, security-reviewer,
//   council-member, design-facilitator, consultant, blind-reader,
//   prose-reviewer, plan-reviewer, scope-adjudicator): the repo tree is
//   read-only. Git and GitHub state changes, writes into the tree, file
//   mutations (delete, move, copy, create, chmod), package installs, and
//   formatters are all denied.
//   Gate-runner (qa-verifier): it builds and runs the suites, so inside a fixed
//   list of build-output directories (bin, obj, TestResults, node_modules, .vs),
//   matched at any depth, it may write and delete freely. Everywhere else in the
//   repo it may not write, delete, move, rename, or overwrite an existing file,
//   and git state, GitHub state, package installs that rewrite a lockfile, and
//   formatters are denied to it as well. That directory list is a policy
//   assumption, not a fact the guard checks: a repo that tracks content under one
//   of those names gets no protection there.
//   Every other agent type, and the main session, is untouched.
// The invariant is the state under review, and .kit/ (gitignored) is scratch
// space both classes may write.
//
// Plugin PreToolUse hooks fire for tool calls made inside subagents, and the
// payload carries the subagent identity, so the guard keys on the caller's role.
// Reads stay open by construction (a denylist blocks only what it names): git
// diff, git log, git grep, git merge-base, rg, dotnet build, dotnet test,
// node --test, and a redirect into .kit/ all run.
//
// Command text is analyzed against a quote-masked copy of itself: every
// position-finding pattern (a command name, a redirect operator, a segment
// separator) runs against a string whose quoted spans are blanked out, while
// operand text is read from the original. So a verb or a > inside a quoted
// argument is invisible (rg "the git commit flow" docs/ is a read), while
// echo x > "src/file" is still a write. A nested executor (sh -c, bash -c,
// pwsh -Command, cmd /c, eval, iex, claude -p, a here-string) has its payload
// analyzed recursively within a depth bound, reconstructed the way that executor
// assembles it rather than one argument at a time, and a command substitution the
// shell runs, at the top level, inside a double-quoted span, or standing in an
// arithmetic operand, is blanked as a span and scanned as its own command.
// Whatever that depth bound leaves unexpanded, a substitution's interior and an
// executor's payload alike, is denied as unresolvable rather than trusted as
// data, so the common quoting evasions are closed. A token the guard
// reads as a name but cannot resolve, because a substitution is spliced into it,
// denies on the same rule. This is a best-effort lexer over shell
// grammar rather than a shell, and like every kit guard it is no security
// boundary: every agent runs as the one machine principal, so the guard defends
// the work against well-intentioned-but-wrong agent behavior (a reviewer
// "fixing" the code under review), not against an attacker. The tree-state
// check the orchestrator runs around each review round backstops it. That check
// compares two `git status --porcelain` readings rather than the bytes on disk,
// so it is blind to a whole class the direct git and gh scans exist to cover: a
// hidden push, and equally a merge or a reset --hard moving HEAD and the
// worktree together, each leave that reading identical and so produce nothing
// for it to detect, which is why those verbs are denied here at the command
// rather than left to the backstop.
// Containment is judged against the git root above the payload cwd, and relative
// operands resolve against any cd or Set-Location the command performs first, so
// neither a subdirectory cwd nor a directory switch moves a repo path out of
// scope.
//
// SAFETY: this hook can BLOCK a tool call, so a guard MALFUNCTION fails OPEN:
// any parse error, unrecognized payload, missing command, or unidentifiable
// agent exits 0 (allow), and an absent cwd skips the cwd-dependent path checks
// (no target can be placed without one) while the path-independent heuristics,
// a git, gh, formatter, or package mutation among them, still deny. A guard
// bug must never trap legitimate review work. Operand ambiguity the command author chose is a different question, and
// it takes a per-site judgment rather than that posture: a path operand
// built through a variable outside the resolvable subset ($PWD, ${PWD}, %CD%, a
// home-relative path) still cannot be positively placed and allows, a cd target
// the guard cannot read falls back to the payload cwd, and a destructive cmdlet
// an enumerating pipeline feeds denies with its operand unresolved. Command
// text the guard cannot resolve (a substitution or an executor payload nested
// past the depth bound, a name with a substitution spliced into it) fails
// CLOSED and denies.

// A copy of the command with every character inside a single- or double-quoted
// span replaced by NUL, preserving length so indexes stay usable against the
// original. Backslash escapes follow bash's two context rules, which differ: at
// the top level a backslash escapes ANY following character, so \" and \' are
// literal quotes that neither open nor close a span (a rule that must include
// the single quote, or echo \' opens a phantom span that blanks the rest of the
// command while bash runs it); inside a double-quoted span a backslash escapes
// only " \ $ or `, so a Windows separator ("src\file") stays a literal
// backslash rather than swallowing the next character. The double-quote rule is
// the reason sh -c "sh -c \"...\"" is read as one span rather than flipping
// quote parity for the rest of the line. Single-quoted spans are literal. An
// unterminated quote masks to the end of the string. Quoted text matches no
// pattern, which is what makes a governed verb or a redirect operator inside an
// argument invisible.
//
// A command substitution ($(...) or backticks) is the exception to both rules:
// the shell runs it wherever quoting does not suppress it, so it is live command
// text rather than data, at the top level and inside a double-quoted span alike.
// Every such span is blanked whole with the SUB_SPAN sentinel, which keeps
// operand boundaries byte-identical to what the shell reads: a `)` or a closing
// tick standing in an operand ($(pwd), `true`) never truncates the operand list
// the way an exposed one would. The interior is instead collected into the `subs`
// out-parameter (when the caller passes one), for the caller to scan on its own
// as live command text, which is why echo "$(git commit -m x)" and
// rm $(true) README.md both deny. A $(( opener is confidently arithmetic only
// where the span is exactly one parenthesized group, its inner ( matching the )
// before the outer close (echo "$((1 > 2))" runs no command); every other $((
// shape is treated as a command substitution wrapping a subshell that bash runs
// (echo "$((git push) )", whose inner and outer ) are split by a space, and
// $((git push);(true)), which holds two groups, both run git push), so its
// interior is collected like any other. An arithmetic span is blanked too, but
// never without a scan: bash expands a command substitution standing in an
// arithmetic operand whatever quoting surrounds it ($(( '$(cmd)' )) runs cmd, and
// the arithmetic error that follows comes after the run), so every $( and backtick
// inside one is collected as a span of its own. The arithmetic text around them is
// not read as a command, because its operators are not shell syntax: the > in
// $((1 > 2)) is a comparison rather than a redirect. A process substitution is not
// performed on an arithmetic operand, so a <( inside one opens nothing. A
// process substitution (<(...)) is live at the top level and masked the same way
// there, but inside double quotes bash performs none, so there it masks as
// ordinary quoted text. A >( span is left as it stands: the redirect scan reads
// its > as a redirect whose (...) target classifies in-tree, a deny-leaning
// over-read that keeps rm >(x) README.md refused, so masking the span would
// trade a deny away rather than add one. Single quotes suppress
// substitution, so a span inside them stays literal, and a substitution opener
// inside a quoted-delimiter heredoc body is data the sink copies, so a body
// range opens nothing.
//
// The `bodies` argument names the ranges of quoted-delimiter heredoc bodies. A
// heredoc body is literal data, so a quote character in it is a byte rather than
// a shell quote: read as a quote it would open a span that blanks the live
// command text after the body (one stray apostrophe hides an entire mutation
// standing after the terminator). Quotes inside a body range are therefore left
// as literal characters, and a span opened outside a body ends where a body
// begins.
// The sentinel a substitution span masks to. It differs from the NUL quoted spans
// use because the two need different treatment when a segment is tokenized: quoted
// text keeps its original characters (git "commit" runs commit, so the token must
// still read commit), while a substitution expands to text the guard cannot know,
// so its span must ride as one opaque word rather than as raw $( text a whitespace
// split would break apart. The input cannot spell it: a raw control character is
// refused at the boundary before any mask is built.

// match nothing and fall through to allow. Standing as a destructive command's

// rm $FOO/x does not place), which stays an allow deliberately, priced against

// tree-state bracket, a bulk idiom other than find, xargs, and the two
// PowerShell pipeline shapes the scan names (a destructive cmdlet piped its

// (echo push origin main | xargs git runs git push while the scan compares
// only a literal subcommand), an operand standing past a redirect in the same
// simple command (rm >/dev/null README.md hands rm the operand while the
// segmenter's cut at the redirect drops it; the spelling that carries a
// descriptor prefix denies instead, on the prefix itself read as an operand,
// so the bare redirect is the example rather than that one; a miss accepted
// rather than fixed at the segmenter's cut set, whose edits have outsized
// blast radius), and a git
// subcommand that writes files as a side effect of a read (git format-patch,
// git archive), which leaves a tracked-file delta the backstop does see, a
// redirect standing inside a heredoc body (a `>`, `>>`, or `>|` inside a `<<`
// or `<<-` body): maskHeredocRedirects blanks it, which reads an authored
// script's comparison or arrow correctly and also hides a real write when a
// downstream executor runs the body (cat <<'EOF' ... echo pwned > README.md
// ... EOF piped to sh performs the write while the blanked redirect reads as
// data; the governed verbs in such a body still deny, so the residual is the
// body whose only mutation is its redirects), a write whose file delta the
// backstop does see, and a
// literal heredoc body a data sink writes away from the tree that a later,
// separately scanned command then runs. That last one is what the data-sink
// exemption adds. Stated by shape: a body written to a path the class may write
// (.kit/ for the strict class, and the build-output directory list for the gate
// class) or to any path outside the tree under review, and executed by a later
// command that reads it as script (bash <path>, sh <path>, . <path>,
// source <path>, an interpreter with a file operand such as node <path> or
// python <path>, or $(cat <path>) in command position) is
// a repo-state mutation the tree-state check cannot see once that command runs,
// rather than the file delta the check does see. The out-of-tree destination
// widens this residual from the writable set to any path, and it opens nothing
// the `printf '<mutation>' > /tmp/x.sh` spelling did not already leave open. It
// is the heredoc spelling of the miss `printf '<mutation>' > .kit/x.sh` already
// makes, and it is left open because no spelling of it is caught rather than
// because one is: `bash <path>`, `sh <path>`, `. <path>`, `source <path>` and an
// interpreter with a file operand all allow, the whole-shape recognizer having
// replaced the executor screen a shell name would once have been read by. One
// further miss is unreachable rather than exploitable and is recorded as such:
// an unterminated command substitution loses its last character at each
// collection level (`subs` records its interior as ending one character before
// a close that is not there), so the innermost verb of `echo $(( $(git push`
// scans truncated and would allow, but bash refuses the same string with an EOF
// error before running anything, so no shell ever executes what the truncation
// hides. In the

// nameable path among them, since a body whose output the guard cannot follow to
// a resting place may be a command wherever it sits), and a governed invocation
