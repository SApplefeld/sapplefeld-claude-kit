# The silent store sync: commit what the allowlist admits, fetch from the
# configured upstream, screen every incoming blob against the allowlist,
# rebase onto the fresh tracking ref, push, and record the outcome to
# <StoreRoot>/kit-sync-state.json. The SessionStart hook (memory-session.js)
# spawns this detached whenever the store is pending; it can also be run by
# hand with an explicit -StoreRoot. Either way every git call runs through
# Invoke-MemorySyncGit's environment guard, so a hand run's shell GIT_*
# variables (GIT_SSH_COMMAND, GIT_ASKPASS among them) do not reach git.
#
# There is no default store root: the real store root holds
# .credentials.json, settings.json, and history.jsonl, so a forgotten
# argument must be a loud parameter error rather than a sync attempt against
# the operator's home. That is the same no-default rule
# install-memory-sync.ps1 applies, and this script dot-sources that file for
# every probe and for the commit itself, so the two cannot answer the safety
# questions differently.
#
# This script never prints and always exits 0. It runs detached with its
# streams ignored, so anything it wrote would go nowhere, and a nonzero exit
# would tell nobody anything; the state file is the whole report, as fixed
# enum codes and ISO timestamps, never free text. The hook reads it and maps
# the codes onto its own fixed literals, which is what keeps store-derived
# text out of the session context. The two gates that mean the store is not
# this system's repository at all (git-missing, foreign) write no state file
# either. The single-flight lock is the one exception: it is created before the
# ownership gate is evaluated (the gate needs the dot-sourced installer), so a
# by-hand run against a foreign directory does create, and then remove on exit,
# a kit-sync.lock there; only a run killed in that brief window leaves it. The
# SessionStart hook never reaches this path against a foreign store, because it
# checks ownership before it spawns.
#
# The mutation bar is the doctor's own PASS bar, re-derived on every run
# through Get-MemorySyncStatus and never cached: git available, the store
# root the doctor's own repository, both managed files Canonical, all four
# leak probes run and answered clean, HEAD readable and attached, and the
# dirty probe itself answered. A run that fails the bar records a gate state
# (or nothing, for the two silent gates above) and mutates nothing at all:
# no init, no add, no commit, no network. The IsRepo gate in particular is
# what keeps Install-MemorySyncRepo's git-init branch unreachable from here;
# this script never creates a repository, a remote, or a branch. The commit
# itself goes through Install-MemorySyncRepo, whose pre- and post-add index
# gates still guard the add and whose commit message is the canonical one.
#
# The network flow is fetch-first. The fetch carries no URL and no refspec,
# so the configured upstream is the only place this script ever speaks to,
# and the ahead/behind counts are read only after it, from the fresh
# tracking ref; counts read from a stale ref would call a behind store
# converged and doom every later push. When the fetch shows incoming
# commits, every ENTRY the incoming upstream tree holds is checked, on both a
# tree entry's security-relevant axes, before the rebase touches the tree: its
# mode must be a regular file (a symlink or gitlink at an allowlisted path is
# refused, since a materialized symlink would turn a later memory read into an
# arbitrary-file read) and its path must be allowlisted and traversal-free. A
# disallowed entry refuses the whole intake as inbound-leak, with no merge and
# no push, because a rebase would plant it in the live store root where nothing
# un-writes it. The screen is over tree entries rather than the fetch's new blob
# objects on purpose: an object screen is blind to a disallowed path that reuses
# a blob HEAD already has (a rename, or duplicate content), which is exactly how
# settings.json or a credential file would slip in. A tree that cannot be listed
# or parsed is unproven and retries silently rather than being accused of a
# leak. A second, diff-shaped read follows it and carries the machine axis: the
# entries that differ between the merge base and the incoming commit, filtered
# to this machine's own coordinator directory, whose contract is single-writer.
# Any entry there refuses the intake as inbound-foreign-write, since the whole-
# tree screen cannot see which admitted paths a commit rewrites. Outbound the
# same axis runs inside the installer, over the paths its add staged, and its
# refusal is recorded here as outbound-foreign-write. The upstream is resolved to a fixed commit once, and that commit is what
# the screen reads and the rebase replays onto, so a concurrent fetch cannot
# advance the ref between the two. Only when every incoming entry is admitted
# does the rebase run, and after it the whole bar is re-derived before the push,
# so nothing that fails the re-check is published onward. A paused merge,
# cherry-pick, revert, rebase, or `git am` in the store defers the whole run, so
# no conflict markers are ever committed.
#
# Single-flight: kit-sync.lock in the store root, created exclusively and
# carrying the owner's process id and an ISO timestamp. A live lock is a
# concurrent run in progress, which is not a failure, so that path exits
# without touching the state file at all. A lock is stale when its process is
# gone, when the live process holding its pid started after the lock was
# written (a reused pid, so the true owner is gone), or when its timestamp sits
# in the future (a clock that jumped backward would otherwise pin a crashed
# lock fresh forever); a live owner that predates its lock is never stale, so a
# slow fetch keeps it, and the 15-minute age horizon decides only when the lock
# cannot be parsed or the owner's start time cannot be read. Takeover goes
# through a rename, so two runs that both judge the lock stale cannot both win,
# and removal on exit checks the lock still names this process before deleting
# it. Both the lock and the
# state file (and their temporaries) sit at the store root, where the
# allowlist's exclude-all rule keeps them out of every add.

# Whether every entry the upstream tree holds is one the allowlist admits, on

# where nothing un-writes it. `ls-tree -r @{upstream}` names every entry the
# tree holds, and reading the mode column (not `--name-only`) is what closes
# the second axis: only a regular file (100644/100755) may enter. A symlink
# (120000) or a gitlink (160000) at an allowlisted path would otherwise be
