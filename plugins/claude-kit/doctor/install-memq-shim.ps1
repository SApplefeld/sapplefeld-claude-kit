# The doctor's memq-shim helpers: what an install consists of, whether the
# installed copy is the expected one, whether it resolves a payload, and
# whether the name `memq` actually reaches it.
#
# Dot-sourced by doctor.ps1, which calls these under its "memq shim" check;
# the repo test suite dot-sources the same file and runs the same functions
# against redirected directories, which is why the plugin root, the .claude
# directory, and the PATH value all arrive as parameters instead of being
# resolved from the environment here. This file defines functions only;
# dot-sourcing it runs nothing and writes nothing.
#
# An install is five files in <ClaudeDir>\bin: memq-shim.js (a byte copy of
# the payload's scripts\memq-shim.js, which holds all the cache resolution
# logic), three wrappers that delegate to it, one per shell that resolves
# a command differently: memq.ps1 for PowerShell, memq.cmd for cmd, and an
# extensionless memq for Git Bash, and kit-statusline.js (a byte copy of the
# payload's scripts\kit-statusline.js, the status-line widget launcher, which
# resolves the payload through the shim beside it and is run by full path
# from a status-line tool's settings, so it needs no wrapper). Each wrapper's
# exact text is defined once here and used by both the writer and the
# integrity check, so the check cannot drift from what the installer writes;
# each .js copy is checked byte-for-byte against the payload's own.
#
# Three wrappers rather than one because the shells disagree about both
# resolution and argument passing. PowerShell searches for .ps1 by its own
# rules, independently of PATHEXT, and prefers a .ps1 over a sibling .cmd, so
# shipping memq.ps1 is what keeps PowerShell callers off cmd.exe's command
# line parser. That matters: a batch wrapper can only forward its arguments as
# %*, which cmd.exe substitutes into the line before parsing it, so an
# argument carrying an odd number of double quotes ends the quoted region and
# text after a following '&' runs as a separate command. memq.cmd still
# carries that exposure for callers that reach it (cmd.exe itself, which does
# not resolve .ps1), which is why memq bounds its stored free text and the
# memory-system skill tells the model to compose summaries rather than paste
# raw text into an argument.
#
# The durable PATH edit is deliberately not here: it writes User-scope
# registry state, which doctor.ps1 owns and a test must never touch. The
# read half and the membership predicate do live here, so the doctor's writer
# and this file's diagnosis answer "is that directory on PATH" identically.

# The five files an install consists of.

# Integrity is a content comparison, not only a smoke run. A shim that runs
# and prints a usage banner proves that something ran; any payload that took
# its place could print the same banner. Comparing the installed bytes against
# this payload's own answers the question that matters, which is whether the
# expected program is what is installed.

# the answer, because it is what a shell actually runs. Only when nothing
# resolves does the durable PATH decide, which is the honest reading of "this
# process's PATH predates the fix, and new shells will find it". A `memq`
# resolving from another directory is reported by path and never smoothed
# over: the durable PATH is appended to, so any earlier entry (user-writable
# ones such as WindowsApps included) wins every invocation.
