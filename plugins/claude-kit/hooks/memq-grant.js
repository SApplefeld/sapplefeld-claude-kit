// PreToolUse grant: under the engine's write-gated spawn vector, Bash refuses
// `node <script>` even for the kit's own memq CLI, so a fleet worker on that
// vector loses memory recall and outcome logging. This hook emits an allow
// decision for exactly one command shape and stays silent on everything else.
//
// The grant requires ALL of:
//   - The fleet-store signals: KIT_MEMORY_ROOT set and
//     KIT_MEMORY_ROOT_ALLOW_DATA === '1'. The check is memq's own exported
//     storeSignalsPresent(), required from the scripts/ directory beside this
//     hook, so the hook and the CLI cannot drift apart on what a fleet store
//     is. memq.js dispatches only under require.main, so the load runs no CLI
//     code, and a load failure means no grant (granting an invocation of a
//     script that cannot load serves nobody).
//   - The tool is Bash and the command is one `node` invocation whose first
//     argument is an absolute spelling that resolves, by normalized path
//     equality, to this plugin's own scripts/memq.js. The target is anchored
//     to the hook's on-disk location (__dirname), never to an environment
//     variable, so no inherited setting can point the grant at another tree.
//     Path equality, never a pattern: a lookalike path, a traversal landing
//     elsewhere, a same-named script under another root, and a symlink
//     spelled from another path all fail it. Relative spellings are refused
//     outright: the Bash tool's shell keeps a working directory across calls
//     that nothing pins to the payload cwd, so a relative target cannot be
//     positively resolved. On Windows a target must carry a drive-letter root
//     as written, and no other spelling is converted into one. A rootless
//     slash path resolves against this process's current drive while the
//     child's shell maps it elsewhere, and the /d/... spelling Git-Bash
//     accepts is rewritten by the MSYS runtime at exec, under an environment
//     variable that shell can be carrying from an earlier call and that this
//     hook cannot observe from its own process. Both spellings therefore name
//     one file to this hook and can name another to the child, which is the
//     divergence every rule here exists to prevent.
//   - The arguments past the script path are screened, not passed through.
//     node hands everything after the script to the script, so these are
//     memq's argv and memq validates its own input, but the grant is narrower
//     than the CLI: a prompt-free allow with no operator in the loop does not
//     cover a command that removes a shared record, reads a caller-named path
//     into the store, or loads code out of a directory this hook cannot
//     bound. The verb is judged by allowlist: the word right after the script
//     path, which is the one place memq reads a subcommand from, must be one
//     of the verbs this grant is meant to cover, and every other word there
//     withholds it. Left out of that list are delete-type and delete-operator,
//     which remove a shared-tier record outright; find, which loads an
//     embedder out of a directory the command line does not name and can
//     stand no part of that load down, the ranking being its whole output;
//     anchor, which rewrites a project-tier
//     record in place at a name the command line gives it, and with it the
//     claim every drift surface reads about which files that memory is still
//     true of; and triggers, which rewrites a record of any tier the same way
//     at the record's other half, the line that decides when that memory is
//     put in front of a session. Seven flag shapes are refused wherever in the
//     command they sit, since that is where a flag can appear:
//     --body-file, which reads a caller-named path into the store; --update
//     carrying --body, which replaces a shared record's body whole;
//     --supersedes, which demotes and labels a record no pin protects from
//     it; --trigger, which writes that same recognition line at a record's
//     birth and so would reach through a granted verb what the triggers verb
//     is withheld for; --rollup, which folds every expired journal entry's
//     prose into a tally and keeps the text in a single local .bak the sync
//     never carries; --drop-malformed, which deletes the sidecar lines
//     the rollup rewrite preserves; and --type=<type>, the attached spelling
//     alone, which points a granted read or applied stamp at any type tier
//     the store holds rather than at the one the calling project declared,
//     the bare --type spelling keeping its grant for exactly that reason.
//     memq refuses the deletes, the body-file, the body-carrying update, the
//     supersedes pointer, the trigger and the named type spelling under the
//     store signals as well, so those seven are a second lock rather than the
//     only one, and it refuses one shape of an eighth, a `triggers --replace`
//     reaching a shared tier or a pinned project store;
//     find, anchor, the rest of triggers and --rollup
//     are withheld here alone, and --drop-malformed's other lock is the
//     CLI's own coupling (an argument error without --rollup) rather than a
//     store-signal refusal, so its screen here is what holds if that
//     coupling is ever loosened. What a withheld grant costs on this vector
//     is the capability itself: no operator is watching a fleet worker's
//     session, so the command does not run rather than waiting for an
//     approval. Each withholding below is chosen against that price, not
//     against a prompt.
//   - The interpreter is positively identified, not accepted by name. The
//     word `node` resolves through PATH in the child's shell, and this hook
//     inherits the same environment that child would get, so it walks that
//     PATH itself and grants only when the first `node` candidate it finds is
//     this very interpreter (realpath equality with process.execPath; on
//     Windows the wrapper spellings node.cmd/.bat/.com/.ps1 and an
//     extensionless `node` are candidates too, and none of them can equal the
//     real binary, so a planted wrapper anywhere ahead of it refuses). The
//     variables that select code for the granted child are refused outright
//     whenever they are set at all: NODE_OPTIONS (carries --require/--import),
//     NODE_PATH (steers module resolution), and NODE_REPL_EXTERNAL_MODULE (a
//     preloaded module). All three are node's own. No variable naming an
//     embedder directory is among them, for the reason PRELOAD_ENV states
//     below: the verb whose whole output is that load is withheld from the
//     grant, and the granted verbs that can reach the same require stand
//     their own check down whenever such a variable is set at all, so the
//     directory question is bounded rather than screened for.
//   - The whole command line is free of shell metacharacters: ; & | < > ` $
//     ( ) are refused anywhere, quoted spans included. The scan deliberately
//     does not parse quoting to be lenient inside it; quote parity is
//     shell-dependent (the memq.cmd %* expansion is the recorded example), so
//     bluntness is the design. Every C0 control byte and DEL is refused
//     anywhere too, tab excepted: bash strips NUL from a command line
//     outright, so a word screened here as delete-type\0 would reach the
//     child as delete-type, and what a shell does with the rest of that class
//     is unspecified rather than agreed. Word separators are space and tab
//     only, and every other whitespace character (NBSP, the Unicode
//     separators, and the controls the class above already takes) is refused
//     anywhere, because bash does not split on them and a splitter that did
//     would judge different words than the shell builds. Refused for the same
//     words-must-match reason: a backslash immediately before a quote, a
//     backslash outside a quoted span (bash consumes it), and an unquoted
//     word starting with # (bash drops the rest of the line as a comment).
//   - No word is one bash would rewrite before the child sees it. A brace,
//     a glob or a bracket in an unquoted span is refused, because brace and
//     pathname expansion happen after this hook has read the line and can
//     turn one word into several ({delete-type,--confirm-shared} is two words
//     to bash and one to any tokenizer that does not expand). A word opening
//     with an unquoted tilde is refused, because tilde expansion substitutes
//     the caller's own HOME into it and every screen here is a content test.
//     Both are span-scoped, since bash performs neither inside quotes, so a
//     description carrying [note] or ~/.claude is ordinary text. A tilde
//     later in a word is literal too, with one admitted exception noted at
//     the splitter: an assignment-shaped word expands after its = and after
//     each : within it, and keeps its non-tilde prefix, so it can become
//     neither a screened token nor the script path.
//
// Threat model: the expensive failure is a silent over-grant, a command this
// hook allows that runs anything other than this plugin's memq.js under this
// plugin's own interpreter. The metacharacter ban removes chaining,
// substitution, and redirection; the path equality removes substitute
// scripts; the interpreter pin removes a PATH-planted node, while node -e,
// npx, node.exe, and interpreters at other paths are refused as spellings
// before the pin is even consulted; the code-selection refusal removes code
// injected into a genuine invocation through the environment; the word rules
// keep the child's word list the same list this hook screened; and the
// argument screen keeps the commands that are not fit for a prompt-free allow
// out of the grant.
//
// The word list is the same list, and the words themselves diverge in one
// admitted way: bash collapses a doubled backslash to one inside a
// double-quoted span, and the splitter below copies a quoted span verbatim,
// so a word carrying \\ reaches the child one character shorter than this
// hook read it. Refusing a backslash inside quotes is not available, since
// the script path is quoted and full of backslashes on Windows, and the
// divergence is harmless against what the screens actually test. Those are a
// whole-word match against tokens that contain no backslash, and a
// path.resolve equality against this hook's own location. The collapse only
// ever removes a backslash, so a word that carries one still carries one
// after it and can never become a screened token, a screened token carries
// none and so passes through the collapse unchanged, and the two spellings of
// the target path resolve to the same file because path.resolve normalizes
// repeated separators.
//
// SAFETY: this hook only GRANTS; it never denies and never exits 2. On any
// input outside the one shape, any parse failure, unreadable payload,
// unresolvable path or interpreter, or exception, it emits no decision and
// exits 0, which falls through to the engine's normal permission flow. For a
// grant hook, silence is the safe failure: the opposite direction from the
// kit's deny guards, whose fail-open is allowing.

// add-operator, delete-type, delete-operator, decay-scan, decay-prune and
// decay-done, and the five absent here are the two deletes, find, anchor, and
// triggers.
//
// anchor is the fourth, and it is withheld on what it authors rather than on
// what it destroys: it rewrites a record of the project tier in place, at a
// name the command line gives it. What the rewritten line buys is a claim
// about which files the memory is about and at which bytes, so a worker could
// re-anchor a record onto whatever the tree holds now and every drift surface
// would then report that memory as verified when nobody read it. The CLI has
// no second refusal for the verb, since it is the operator's own, so this
// screen is the only one.
//
// triggers is the fifth and is withheld on a wider account, at the record's
// other half: it rewrites a record of any tier in place, the type and operator
// tiers included, and the line it writes is what decides when that memory is
// put in front of a session. A worker could aim a record's recognition at
// whatever it liked, or crowd the line to the entry cap so the triggers the
// operator wrote go unread, with nothing on any surface saying the declaration
// changed. Its --replace reaches further than either: it states the line
// whole, so a run naming a single entry takes every other declaration off the
// record and one naming none takes the line away, which is erasure rather than
// aiming and leaves the record with no recognition at all. The tier flags are
// what make the blast radius wider than anchor's: the same rewrite on a
// machine-wide tier aims or erases recognition for every project on the box
// and every machine the store syncs to, rather than for the one project a
// worker was pointed at. The --confirm-shared the CLI asks for that replace is
// no second lock, being a flag rather than a person on this vector. What does
// stand behind this screen, for that one shape alone, is memq's own refusal of
// a replace reaching a shared tier or a pinned project store under the store
// signals; the aiming half of the verb and its unpinned project-tier replace
// have no such refusal, for anchor's reason, so for those this screen is again
// the only one.
//
// An allowlist rather than a denylist, because the two fail in opposite
// directions: a verb added to the CLI later is not covered until this list
// learns it, where a denylist would cover it the day it lands and say nothing.
// Of the shapes this grant withholds, find has no second lock in the CLI, so
// a new verb that loads code or reads a caller-named path would arrive with
// no layer refusing it at all. The cost is availability, and it is the right
// direction for a grant surface: the failure of an allowlist is a fleet
// worker losing a verb nobody has listed yet until this list learns it, and
// on an unattended vector a lost capability is recoverable by editing this

// Shell words of a metacharacter-clean command: space and tab split, a quoted
// span joins onto the current word the way the shell joins it ("a"b is one

// an unterminated quote, a backslash outside a quoted span, an unquoted word
// starting with # (a comment to bash, words to this splitter), an unquoted
// expansion character, and an unquoted tilde opening a word, where bash would
// hand the child either a different list of words than this one or a
// different word.
//
// The tilde is refused here, inside the splitter, because its significance is
// positional and a finished word no longer records where its characters came
// from. Bash expands a tilde only as a word's first character and only
// unquoted, substituting the caller's own HOME before the child is executed,
// and every screen past this point is a content test over the word list:
// HOME=delete-type turns a bare ~ into the delete verb, in a list where each
// of those screens has already passed. A tilde anywhere else in a word is
// literal, and admitting it is what keeps this splitter's word equal to the
// shell's: bash leaves a:~/y, --f=~/x and /a/~/b exactly as they are, so
// refusing one here would withhold the grant over a word nothing rewrites.
// (A Windows 8.3 short path such as C:\\Users\\ACCOUN~1\\... is one such word,
// though it is not one the grant covers: the target is judged by
// path.resolve equality with no realpathSync anywhere, so an 8.3 spelling of
// the script path is refused at the path check like any other spelling that
// is not the resolved one.) A tilde reached through a quoted span
// is literal wherever it sits, which is what "~/.claude is the store root"
// is: a description, not a path.
//
// One word shape is not literal and is admitted anyway: bash also expands a
// tilde after the = of an assignment-shaped word and after each : within
// one, so FOO=~ reaches the child as FOO=/home/you and A=x:~ as
// A=x:/home/you. An assignment-shaped word begins with an identifier
// character, and the expansion keeps everything before the tilde, so such a
// word can become neither the verb word, which is judged whole against the
// allowlist, nor one of the screened flags (--body-file, --update, --body,
// --supersedes, --trigger, --rollup, --drop-malformed, --type=), each matched
// whole or up to an = and so opening with a hyphen where an assignment-shaped
// word opens with an identifier character, nor the script path, which is
// matched by path equality. What it can become is a longer argument of

    // it replaces only in a local .bak the sync never carries; --body-file
    // anywhere, which reads a caller-named path into the store; --supersedes,
    // which demotes and labels a record no pin protects from it;

    // a read or an applied stamp at any type tier the store holds rather than
    // at the one the calling project declared, the reach the bare --type
    // spelling is granted for, which cmdGet and cmdTouch refuse under those
    // same signals.
    // Four more are withheld here alone, with no second layer behind them:
    // find, which loads an embedder out of a directory the command line does
    // not name; --rollup, which discards prose no copy survives; anchor,
    // which rewrites a project-tier record in place and with it the claim
    // every drift surface reads about which files that memory is still true
    // of; and triggers, which rewrites a record of any tier in place at the
    // half that decides when the memory is put in front of a session, so a
    // worker could aim recognition on a tier every project on the machine
    // reads. One shape of that fourth does have a second lock, which is why
    // the group is named by verb rather than by capability: memq refuses a
    // --replace reaching a shared tier or a pinned project store under the
    // store signals, that being the shape that takes every declaration off a
    // record rather than aiming one, so what is withheld here alone is the
    // aiming and the unpinned project-tier replace. The
    // twelfth, --drop-malformed, deletes sidecar lines behind one
    // .bak generation; what stands behind its screen is the CLI's requirement
    // that the flag ride --rollup, a coupling rather than a store-signal
    // refusal, so this screen is what keeps the delete withheld if that
    // coupling is ever loosened for ergonomics. None of the twelve belongs in
    // a prompt-free allow with no operator in the loop, and the four with no
    // second lock are the ones a later edit here would silently free.
    //
    // This screen is the second lock rather than a move of the first: the CLI
    // evaluates those signals in the child process, this hook evaluates them
    // in its own, and where the two disagree the child both skips its refusal
    // and resolves memoryRoot() to the operator's real store, so a caller-named
    // path would be read into the tier that syncs to a private remote.
    // Withholding a grant is silence, not a deny: the command is not blocked
    // here, it simply gets no prompt-free allow. On the unattended vector
    // this hook serves that is the whole of the outcome, since no operator is
    // there to approve what the grant withholds, so each screen below is
    // chosen knowing it costs a fleet worker the command outright. The flags
    // are matched by screensFlag,
    // which answers for the attached-value spelling as well as the whole
    // word, so what this screen withholds does not depend on how the CLI
    // parses --flag=value.

    // The verb is judged against GRANTED_VERBS, so a word this hook has never
    // heard of withholds rather than passing through. find is the reason the
    // list is shaped that way and is this hook's only lock on it: it loads code
    // out of a directory named outside the command line, requiring
    // scripts/memory-index.js and through it an embedder package under a root
    // that falls back to one inside the caller's own HOME. No environment screen
    // can bound that directory, since HOME is always set, so the verb is left off
    // the list instead. It is not the only verb that can reach that require:
    // add-type and add-operator are granted and their write-time neighbours check
    // reaches it, and decay-scan is granted and its neighbour-pairs block reaches
    // it after the drift block, sweeping the derived vector index and persisting
    // it in process as find's own channel does, each stood down in the child on
    // the presence of KIT_MEMORY_ROOT or KIT_EMBEDDER_ROOT rather than by
    // anything this hook screens. The cost is
    // deliberate and worth naming: a fleet worker gets no semantic search at
    // all, not a prompt for one. It is affordable because recall is the
    // retrieval path an effort starts from by the memory skill's own design,

    // exactly that reach, and a record born carrying the line reaches it

    // add-operator the capability the verb list withholds from `triggers`. The

    // aiming rather than the crowding. memq refuses the flag under the store
    // signals for the same reason, which makes this the second lock rather
    // than the only one, and the second lock is worth its place because the
    // two layers read their environment in separate processes: the divergence
    // case is the one where the CLI's own refusal does not fire and
