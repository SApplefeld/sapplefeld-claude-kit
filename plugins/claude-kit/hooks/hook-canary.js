// SessionStart hook: prove the kit's own hooks are alive in the installed cache.
//
// Every kit hook fails open by design, so a stale or damaged plugin cache, a
// hook file that no longer parses, or a guard whose logic has gone inert takes
// the enforcement away with no signal at all: sessions keep running, unguarded
// and silent. This probes the cache that live sessions actually execute
// (CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT) at every startup and resume, and speaks only when
// something about it is positively broken.
//
// Four probe classes. The first three spawn children, serially and each under a
// bounded timeout; the fourth only reads files:
//   - Load checks for every hook wired in hooks.json: the file is present in
//     the cache and `node --check` parses it. Enumerating hooks.json means a
//     hook added later is covered without touching this file. `node --check`
//     compiles without executing, so it says nothing about a require() that
//     fails to resolve (kit-goal-stop.js depends on kit-goal-lib.js, which
//     hooks.json never names); the behavior probes are what exercise that.
//   - Known-answer behavior probes, in both directions (a known deny and a
//     known allow, so a guard that answers everything the same way cannot read
//     as healthy), for the hooks whose verdict is deterministic from a
//     fabricated payload with no repo, git, or network state.
//   - Export-contract probes of the shared libraries hooks require but
//     hooks.json never names, so the load checks above never reach them: the
//     module is required in a child and asked for the readings its callers
//     destructure, because a cache one version behind can hold one that loads
//     and exports the wrong set, which every caller answers by failing open.
//   - An integrity check of the cache against the hash manifest the build
//     stamps into .claude-plugin/build-info.json: a hook whose bytes are not the
//     ones that were packaged is reported even when it parses and answers every
//     probe above correctly. The plugin cache is writable by the same principal
//     a session runs as, and a hook edited in place enforces whatever it now
//     says, which nothing else here can see.
//
// Coverage limits, accepted: merged-pr-push-guard.js and pr-docs-guard.js get a
// load check plus a benign-payload plumbing probe only, because their deny
// paths need confirmed external state (a MERGED pull request via the host CLI,
// a dirty checkout on a non-default branch), so their behavior coverage lives
// in the repo test suite. And this measures a cache's internal consistency, not
// its freshness against the repo: a stale but coherent cache reads healthy
// (kit-version-nudge.js is what watches for drift). The integrity check inherits
// the limit of a manifest that ships inside the cache it describes: an edit to a
// hook and to the manifest together is undetectable from here.
//
// SAFETY: always exits 0, and the loud/silent boundary is deliberate. Anything
// positively observed about the cache being broken (a failed probe, a missing
// hook file, a missing or unparseable hooks.json, a plugin root that is not
// there) is reported into the session context. An unexpected error inside this
// hook's own code stays silent through the outer catch: a canary bug must never
// warn at every session start. Residual blind spot: if Node itself is missing
// the canary cannot run either, and the harness surfaces the failed command.
//
// The sweep does not run at all under KIT_EXTERNAL_ENGINE=1, the marker an
// external engine sets on the sessions it spawns: the payload a spawn runs is
// the deploy's concern, and the report targets an attended operator who can act
// on it, so a headless worker pays none of the serial child spawns.

// Both directions of the memq grant, judged by stdout. A grant hook that has
// gone inert never announces itself in use (a fleet worker just quietly loses
// memq), and one stuck at always-allow is an open door, so both directions
// are probed like the deny guards' exit probes. The environment is built from
// PROBE_ENV_KEEP rather than inherited: the fleet-store signals point at a
// throwaway path (the hook checks presence, never the disk), PATH is pinned
// to this interpreter's own directory so the hook's interpreter pin resolves
// to the node running this canary, and nothing else the ambient environment
// carries reaches the child. Every direction needs the cache's own
// scripts/memq.js: the hook loads that file to read the store signals, and a
// load that throws is a refusal, so on a cache without it every payload is
// answered with silence whatever it contains. A refusal direction run there
// proves nothing about the screen it names, because the same silence arrives
// from a hook whose screens are all gone. That cache is reported instead of
// probed, because a grant hook that can never grant is the inert half of what
// these probes exist to catch: a fleet worker would quietly lose memq with
// every guard here still reading green.
//
// The refusal directions are chosen so that one screen alone decides them,
// which is what makes a failure name the screen that broke, and the Git-Bash
// drive spelling is the one exception, named below. The hostile command
// carries its metacharacter as a separate word, so the verb the allowlist
// reads is an allowed one and the metacharacter ban is the only thing
// refusing, and the withheld verb and the screened flag each ride in an
// otherwise grantable command.
//
// No payload gives that property to the drive spelling, because two screens
// read the script path: the drive-letter test, and the identity check that
// resolves the path against this hook's own memq.js. A spelling the first
// refuses is one the second refuses too, since resolving a drive-less path
// names some other file, so a failure there says the pair stopped answering
// rather than which of them did. The direction earns its place anyway: between
// them those two are the whole of what keeps a path this process cannot
// resolve out of a prompt-free allow. It is quoted like every other payload
// here so that the word split is not a third answer, since unquoted, a cache
// under a path holding a space splits into words whose third is a fragment of
// the path, which the verb allowlist refuses while the screens under probe go
// unasked.
