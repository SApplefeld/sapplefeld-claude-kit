// kit-size: the size reading behind the kit's size ratchet. Its scope is the
// six roots in ROOTS below: the skills, agents and output-styles directories
// under plugins/claude-kit/, the markdown files directly under home/,
// test/probes/, and test/. Each file it measures there is compared against a
// committed cap in test/size-budget.json, and what changed is reported. A
// tracked file outside those six roots is unmeasured, plugins/claude-kit/hooks/,
// this script's own directory plugins/claude-kit/scripts/,
// plugins/claude-kit/doctor/ and every tracked file at the repository top level
// among them.
// test/size-ratchet.test.js is the gate that consumes it; this file is also the
// CLI a session runs by hand to read a section's size delta.
//
// Sizes are read from worktree content rather than from HEAD, so an uncommitted
// edit anywhere in the corpus moves the reading for every session sharing the
// checkout, and an over-cap failure therefore says the size came from the
// worktree and says whether that path currently differs from HEAD.
//
// The metric is per root, because the two corpora fail differently. Curated
// prose is measured in words, since prose grows by sentence and a line count of
// hard-wrapped markdown says more about the wrap than about the content. Test
// code is measured in lines, with a test-count reading beside it that is
// reported and never capped: the retire rule in the testing-discipline skill
// exists to make the test count go down, so a cap on it would fight the rule.
//
// A word is a whitespace-separated token after the YAML frontmatter is
// stripped, code fences included. Frontmatter is excluded because it is
// machine-read metadata rather than prose, and a fence is included because a
// worked example is content a reader pays for like any other.
//
// The file list comes from `git ls-files` rather than from a directory walk, so
// the caps and the totals are taken from tracked files alone. What that buys is
// a corpus no session's scratch can move: an in-flight file under a measured
// root would otherwise enter the totals, and the caps would drift with whoever
// happened to have a file on disk. Two readings reach past that listing without
// entering those totals, and both are narrow. A committed cap is held against
// its file from worktree content even where git reports that file as untracked,
// since a cap written in the changeset that adds the file is meant to bind it.
// And `report` names every untracked file a measured shape reaches beside its
// totals rather than omitting it silently. The gitignored built copy of the
// doctrine under
// plugins/claude-kit/ stays out on a different mechanism, the root list, which
// holds no root above it; a directory walk would not have reached it either.
//
// The coverage control is the part that earns trust. A ratchet that greens on a
// file it never classified is the expensive failure here, so every tracked file
// under a root is either classified, or named on the short exclusion list
// below, or a failure. The shapes are narrower than the roots on purpose: a new
// kind of file appearing under a root (a reference nested one level deeper, a
// helper beside the tests) reds the ratchet rather than slipping past it
// unmeasured. The mirror holds too: a cap with no measured file behind it is a
// failure, so a deleted file cannot leave its cap rotting in the budget. The one
// state between the two is a cap whose file git reports as untracked and present
// under a measured root, which is how a file and its cap ride in one changeset;
// that state is reported rather than failed for being untracked, and the file is
// measured from the worktree and held to its cap like any other, since the whole
// point of writing the cap in the same changeset is that it binds the file it
// names. What the pending state suppresses is the stale-entry mirror for that one
// key and nothing else.
//
// Two things the control does not reach. A root nobody added to ROOTS: a path
// under no root is not this tool's subject at all, so a whole new curated
// directory ships unmeasured with the ratchet green, and only an edit to that list
// brings it in. And an untracked file a measured shape reaches that no cap names:
// it is in neither the measured set, which is tracked files, nor the pending set,
// which is budget keys, so `check` greens on it and only `report` names it. That is
// deliberate, because a cap for content nobody has committed is a figure with no
// subject, and failing on one would red the gate on another session's untracked
// file in a shared checkout.
//
// A root prefix differing from a listed root in case alone takes a second
// mechanism, because the first one cannot see it. rootHolds compares
// case-insensitively while the shapes stay case-sensitive, so a path spelled
// that way lands unclassified once the classifier sees it, and the classifier
// never sees it: the tracked-path listing filters with git pathspecs, whose
// matching is case-sensitive, so `ls-files -- test/` does not return
// `TEST/one.test.js`. What reaches it is the pathspec cross-check below, an
// unfiltered `git ls-files` filtered by the same case-folding root test: a path
// the unfiltered listing holds and the filtered one does not is a pathspec-blind
// failure. That reading is also the one that would catch a pathspec this file
// gets wrong in any other way, a root whose trailing slash or spelling stops
// matching what git records.
//
// Git runs through hooks/kit-git-lib.js, the shared runner, rather than through
// a spawn written here: it fixes the child's working directory away from the
// repository being asked about, strips every GIT_* variable from the child
// environment, and passes arguments as an array. Its output ceiling is
// MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES, one mebibyte, which the largest test file exceeds, so the
// `report` verb reads a HEAD blob only for a file git reports as changed and
// names any file whose HEAD blob comes back unreadable instead of leaving it
// out. An omitted file would read exactly like a file that did not change, and a
// git call that did not run at all is its own row state rather than a file
// reported as new, since a transient git failure would otherwise print a
// long-standing file's whole size as this section's growth.
//
// Worktree content runs through hooks/kit-read-lib.js, the shared bounded
// reader, for the same reason: the kind verdict comes off the open descriptor,
// so a FIFO at a measured path is refused instead of blocking the read forever,
// a byte ceiling bounds one file, and a partial read never becomes a size, since
// an undercount passes every cap. Containment is checked beside it, so a tracked
// symlink under a measured root pointing out of the checkout is not measured as
// if it were inside it.
//
// The budget read is the same channel and takes the same boundary: the caps
// decide every verdict this tool reaches, so a budget the reviewed checkout does
// not hold is a gate greening against caps that appeared in no diff. Containment
// is required of the default path, which is inside the repository under
// measurement; a path named on --budget is an operator's own subject and is
// allowed to sit anywhere, since naming a budget elsewhere is a legitimate
// reading. Every path this tool prints, to stdout or to stderr, is rendered
// through the goal library's printable-ASCII screen first: a budget key and a
// tracked path are repository-supplied text, and the `report` output is quoted
// into plan-doc Chapters, where a newline inside a path would forge a row. One
// message is outside that channel by construction, the refusal printed when the
// library itself did not load, and it carries the printable-ASCII screen, the
// backtick strip and the leading-hash strip applied inline, since the library that
// owns them is the thing missing. The length cap is the one rule it cannot reuse.
// Every path printed after the repository is resolved takes a second screen at the
// write, which spells it relative to that repository: repoRelativeText below.
//

// The three shared libraries every hostile boundary here runs through: the git

// scripts/kit-goal-statusline.js guards its own hooks require, because a payload
// carrying scripts/ without hooks/ is a real state: an unguarded MODULE_NOT_FOUND
// at load exits 1, and 1 is the code this tool reserves for a ratchet failure, so
// a partial payload would read as a corpus over its caps. Unlike the status line,
// which degrades to a blank widget, this tool cannot measure anything without
// them, so a library the require did not return is a run that could not produce
// a reading, which is exit 2, and the refusal carries the loader's own message so
// the module is named. The message is worded around what the loader said rather
// than around absence, because two states arrive here: a payload with no hooks
// directory at all, and a library that is present and would not load, a syntax
// error inside it being the ordinary case. Reported as an absent payload the
// second sends its reader looking for files that are sitting right there.

//
// Four further states get a row rather than a drop, all for the same reason: a
// changed file left out of the report reads exactly like a file that did not
// change. A changed file whose worktree content this tool would not measure is a
// row in the 'worktree-unreadable' state, a changed file the classifier reached
// and could not place is a row in the 'unmeasured' state, a changed file the
// tracked listing no longer holds is a row in the 'deleted' state, and one the
// index has dropped while the worktree still holds it is a row in the
// 'index-removed' state. The named exclusions are the one silent drop, since the
// budget is data about the corpus rather than a member of it and its own diff is
// the reviewer's subject anyway; the scope line under the totals is what names
// them, so the drop is legible rather than silent about its own existence. The
// exclusion test is on the list itself rather than on the `excluded` set the
// classifier produced, because a deleted excluded path is in no tracked listing
// and so in no such set, and it would otherwise wear the sentence for a path no
// shape reaches.
//
// The index-removed state is what parts a deletion from a file that is still
// there. `git rm --cached` leaves the path on disk, and git then reports it in the
// HEAD diff as deleted AND in the untracked listing as present, so given the
// deleted row it would carry HEAD's whole size as a negative delta: a cut that did
// not happen, which is the one direction a size reading here must never fabricate.
// The row says the file is still present and untracked and carries no delta, and
// the untracked rows below print its live size.
//
// The deleted state is what keeps the unmeasured sentence true. git reports a
// path the index has deleted as differing from HEAD while `git ls-files` no
// longer prints it, so such a path is in `changed` and in no measured entry, and
// reported as unmeasured it would claim the classifier reached a file that is
// not there. `unclassified` is what separates the two: a path on that list is
// tracked and unplaced, and a changed path on neither list has left the corpus.
// HEAD still holds its blob, so its row carries the HEAD size and the negative
// delta, which is the whole reading a deletion has.
//
// Where that HEAD read produces no number the row carries the state it came back
// in, on `headBlobState`, because the states headSize keeps apart mean different
// things about a deletion and the audits this reading serves are deletion efforts:
// a blob past the runner's output ceiling is a real deletion whose size cannot be
// printed, a git call that did not run at all is a reading nobody took, HEAD
// holding no blob is a file added and deleted inside the same changeset, and a
// classifier that could not place the path never asked git anything. One sentence
// over all four would read as the first.
//
// The row list is bounded, and the bound is on the changed paths read rather than
// on the rows produced, because the cost is the reading: every changed row costs up
// to two git spawns, each bounded at GIT_TIMEOUT_MS, and nothing bounds how many
// paths a changeset holds. That was self-limiting while this tool measured one
// known repository by hand; it is not, now that a Chapter's `Delta:` field has every
// leashed run invoke `report` over whatever the section touched. Past the bound the
// remaining changed paths are counted and the count is printed, on the same shape
// the output ceiling uses: a reading that says it was bounded, never a short one
// that reads as a complete list. The bound sits far above any changeset a section
// produces, so what it binds is an audit-scale sweep, whose per-file rows are not
// the reading anyone reads anyway.

// Without it a section whose whole delta sits outside the measured roots (the hooks,

// that grew nothing. Both counts
// are taken because a new file is untracked at exactly the moment a Chapter's

// a whole new file outside the roots reported as nothing at all. The counts are not
// a measurement and no row here names those paths: this tool's subject is the
// roots, and what the line buys is that the silence about everything else is
// legible.
//
// The excluded term is the second silence and it carries the same duty. A changed
// path on the named exclusion list is dropped from the rows deliberately, and it is
// in neither count, because a root does hold it: the budget file is that path, and
// a cap-raising audit is exactly a changeset that edits it.
//
// `unmeasuredRows` is the third silence, and it is the rows' own rather than the
// scope reading's, which is why the caller decides it: a rendered row that names no
// size is a path in this changeset that nothing above measured. Four reach it, all
// ordinary. A changed tracked path a root holds and no shape reaches, a changed
// measured file whose worktree content the reader would not hand over, a deletion
// whose HEAD size never read, and a path removed from the index that no shape
// reaches, so no untracked row below names its size. A bounded list is the same
